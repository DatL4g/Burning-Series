 *
 * The [block] will cancel and re-launch as the lifecycle moves in and out of the target state.
 *
 * ```
 * class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
 *     override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
 *         /* ... */
 *         // Runs the block of code in a coroutine when the lifecycle is at least STARTED.
 *         // The coroutine will be cancelled when the ON_STOP event happens and will
 *         // restart executing if the lifecycle receives the ON_START event again.

 *
 * The best practice is to call this function when the lifecycle is initialized. For
 * example, `onCreate` in an Activity, or `onViewCreated` in a Fragment. Otherwise, multiple
 * repeating coroutines doing the same could be created and be executed at the same time.
 *
 * Repeated invocations of `block` will run serially, that is they will always wait for the
 * previous invocation to fully finish before re-starting execution as the state moves in and out
 * of the required state.
 *
 * Warning: [Lifecycle.State.INITIALIZED] is not allowed in this API. Passing it as a
 * parameter will throw an [IllegalArgumentException].
 *
 * @param state [Lifecycle.State] in which `block` runs in a new coroutine. That coroutine
 * will cancel if the lifecycle falls below that state, and will restart if it's in that state
 * again.
 * @param block The block to run when the lifecycle is at least in [state] state.
